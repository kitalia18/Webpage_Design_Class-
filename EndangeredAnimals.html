			<h2>What Exactly is a Malayan Sun Bear?</h2>
			 <!--This section contains basic information about the Malayan Sun Bear.-->

			<p>The smallest of the world’s eight living bear species, 
			the Malayan sun bear stands at only four or five feet tall and weighs in at 
			60-176 pounds. The Malayan Sun Bear is a mammal that has a lifespan of 25 
			years. This animal has soft, sleek fur that typically black, but can also 
			range from reddish-brown to gray. Additionally, almost every bear has a 
			distinct chest patch that is either yellow, orange, or white and can be 
			speckled or spotted. Its muzzle is broad, but relatively short as well as 
			light colored, giving the bear a dog-like appearance. Furthermore, it has 
			tiny, rounded ears, a wrinkly forehead, and an extremely long tongue that 
			extends from 8-10 inches, helping the bear extract insects, and also its 
			favorite treat, honey (which could explain why the sun bear is also known 
			as the “honey bear”). The sun bear has very large teeth, especially 
			canines, and a high bite force, which help it to open tropical hardwood 
			trees in pursuit of food. Meanwhile, the sun bear’s paws are large and naked, 
			and it has long curved claws, making it well adapted for climbing trees.
			Sun bears do not hibernate, and are primarily diurnal, which means that 
			they are active during the day and inactive or sleeping at nighttime. Bedding 
			usually consists of fallen, hollow logs, but they also sleep standing in trees 
			with cavities or in tree branches above the ground. </p>

			<p>The Malayan Sun bear can be found in the tropical forests of Southeast 
			Asia, more specifically northeastern India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, 
			Malaysia, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. However, the Sun Bear has been 
			extirpated throughout many regions of the continent, and they now live very 
			patchily through much of Southeast Asia.The Sun Bear inhabits primarily in lowland rainforest where there is not 
			only a wide variety of foods to eat, but it also allows them to hide from any 
			predators. Yet, throughout much of their natural range, the Sun Bear has lost 
			vast regions of its habitat because of deforestation in order to clear land 
			for agriculture and cut down rare and tropical trees for the timber agency.</p>

		<h2>Threats and Conservation</h2><!--This section of the webpage contains the 
		the factors that threaten the Malayan Sun Bear as well as what to do to conserve 
		this animal species.-->
			
			</br><!--I added a blank space in between the subheading and the paragraph to
			make the webpage more presentable, separating the heading from the content.-->
			
			<p> Malayan Sun Bears have been recently re-classified as Vulnerable on the 
			<a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/9760/0"target="_blank">IUCN Red 
			List</a> primarily due to the continued destruction of their habitat. 
			Habitat loss is a huge threat to the Sun Bear population and it is 
			particularly caused by human encroachment and illegal logging from both 
			within and outside protected areas in order to grow coffee, rubber plants 
			and oil palms. Malayan Sun Bears also face poachers since bear gallbladders 
			and bile products are used in traditional medicines, and further threats 
			include the capture of sun bears as pets and the killing of bears due to 
			increasing human-bear conflicts. Fire and drought have recently been 
			impacting the sun bear population, causing a decrease in suitable habitat 
			and food availability that results in many bears suffering from starvation.
			Unfortunately, there haven't been any major steps to conserve this species, but 
			there are laws that prohibit international trade and the killing of the Sun 
			Bear (but they are not enforced very well). </p>
