    	    <p id="biopara"><b>Rosalind Elsie Franklin </b> was an English chemist and X-ray 
    	    crystallographer. She is best known for her role in the discovery of the 
    	    structure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" target="_blank">DNA</a> 
    	    and the pioneering use of X-ray diffraction. </p> <!--I created a link which,

    	    <p id="biopara">Rosalind Franklin was born to a British Jewish family and attended a 
    	    private day school at Norland Place in West London--Lindores School for Young 
    	    Ladies in Sussex--and St. Paul’s Girls’ School in London. Later on, she 
    	    studied the Nation Sciences Tripos at Newnham College in Cambridge, where 
    	    she graduated in 1941. Franklin attended the University of Cambridge and 
    	    earned a research fellowship in physical chemistry; however, because of her 
    	    mentor’s, Ronald Norrish, lack of enthusiasm, she joined the British Coal 
    	    Utilization Research Association (BCURA) in 1942 where she started her work 
    	    on coals. Franklin later earned a Ph. D. in 1945.</p>

    	    of the photo, and create a border around it in the page's CSS.-->
    	    
			<p id="biopara">Meanwhile in the fall of 1946, Franklin 
			was appointed at the Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'Etat in 
			Paris, where she worked with crystallographer Jacques Mering. He taught her 
			X-ray diffraction, which would play an important role in her research that 
			led to the discovery of "the secret of life"—the structure of DNA.Franklin 
			pioneered the use of X-rays to create images of crystalized solids in 
			analyzing complex, unorganized matter. Franklin worked as a research associate at 
			the King’s College London in the biophysics unit.  Studying DNA structure with 
			X-ray diffraction, Franklin made a ground-breaking discovery. She, along with 
			her student, Raymond Gosling, took photos of DNA, one of which is known as 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_51" target="_blank">Photo 51,</a>
			critical evidence in identifying its structure. Her contributions to the 
			discovery of the structure of DNA were largely recognized posthumously.</p>

			Wikipedia page regarding Photo 51 on a separate tab.-->
				
			</br><!--I added a blank space to make the webpage more presentable, separating

			<p id="biopara">In the fall of 1956, Franklin discovered that she had ovarian 
			cancer. She continued working throughout the following two years, despite 
			having three operations and experimental chemotherapy. She experienced a 
			10-month remission before her death on April 16, 1958, at the age of 37.</p>
