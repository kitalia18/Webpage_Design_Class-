		<h1>How to Make Shrimp Scampi with Linguine!</h1>
		<hr />
		
		<p><blockquote><i>We have tried different versions of this recipe. Tyler Florence's 
		is the best so far: all the ingredients well balanced, the lemon not overpowering 
		or too tart: probably the additional butter creates the velvety sauce. Delicious 
		and will do again.</i></blockquote></p>
		
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 pound linguini</li>
			<li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
			<li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
			<li>2 shallots, finely diced</li>
			<li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
			<li>Pinch of red pepper flakes, optional</li>
			<li>1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
			<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
			<li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
			<li>1/4 cup finely chopped parsley leaves</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring a large pot of water to boil and add a couple of 
			tablespoons of salt and the linguini. Stir to make sure the pasta separates;
			cover.</li>
			<li>When the water returns to a boil cook for about 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
			<li>Drain the pasta and set aside.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 
			tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat.</li>
			<li>Saute the shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes (if using) until the 
			shallots are translucent. This takes approximately 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
			<li>After you've seasoned the shrimp with salt and pepper, add them to the 
			pan and cook until they have turned pink. This takes approximately 2 to 3
			minutes. Remove the shrimp from the pan and set aside to keep warm.</li>
			<li>In that now emptied pan, add the white wine and lemon juice and bring to 
			a boil.</li>
			<li>Afterwards, add 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil.</li>
			<li>When the butter has melted, return the shrimp to the pan along with the 
			cooked pasta and parsley.</li>
			<li>Stir well and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle a bit of olive oil 
			overtop and serve immediately!</li>
