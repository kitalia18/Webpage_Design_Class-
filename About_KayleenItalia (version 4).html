		<h1>Welcome to Kayleen's Web Page!</h1>
		<hr />
		
		<p><b>I was born July 26, 2000, and I am a Leo.</b> I live in Swedesboro, New Jersey, 
		which is the town you usually pass if you're on your way to the Jersey Shore.
		Likewise, there are a lot of farms near my house. It takes me about 35 minutes to 
		get to school, but an hour if there's a lot of traffic and 26 if you step on it!
		</p> 
		<p>I attended a Catholic grade school from kindergarten to third grade. However, after I moved to 
		a different town, I transferred to the district's public school from 4th to 8th grade.</p>
		<p> I have many hobbies and interests. I love to dance, and I have been dancing 
		since I was 3 years old. Consequently, I am on the Padua Dance Team. Besides dance, 
		I also sing in my church choir, play the flute and violin, and I cook and bake 
		frequently. My favorite meal to cook is shrimp scampi, while my favorite sweet
		treat to bake is chocolate chip cookies. My favorite movie is <i>Safe Haven</i>.</p>
